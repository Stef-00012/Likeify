            <p>
                When you login with Spotify, Likeify only saves the following information:
                
                <div class="list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your Spotify User ID.</li>
                        <li>Your Spotify Display Name.</li>
                        <li>The ID of the playlist that was just created by Likeify.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>When you logout, your Likeify account gets disabled, meaning your playlist won't be synced anymore.<br />If you want to completely delete your ID, Name and Playlist ID from Likeify, please send a mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@liked.spotify.stefdp.lol">privacy@liked.spotify.stefdp.lol</a> asking to do so.</p>
